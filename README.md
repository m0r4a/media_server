# Jellyfin project

This is my first project creating a server and using docker.

I had some complications with the file permissions because of the media source being on a different partition but I managed to fix it after a wile.

I think I don't need much more to add much more to this since im not a very big fan of watching movies or series but it was cool to get my feet wet with docker and servers.
